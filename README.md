PF 2013 from Georgik :-)

You can play this small game at: http://georgik.sinusgear.com/2012/12/22/pf-2013/

This small PF is written in JavaScript. It's using jQuery in combination with HTML5 canvas.
Animation and movement is using jQuery. HTML5 canvas is present only for checking which part of scene is walkable.
